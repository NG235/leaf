## Chaining Inputs
You are able to chain inputs together when running Leaf. Look at the examples below to get an understanding of how this works.

On launching Leaf, simply chain your imputs together. Enter the ``category`` number, and the ``item`` number to quickly access the item.

Example (Calculators > BMI):

```
0 0
```
You can also add item inputs onto the chain, as long as the inputs are all in the correct order.

Example (Caluclators > BMI (with inputs)):
```
0 0 70 1.65
```
The example above shows navigating to the ``BMI`` calculator, then pre-entering both ``weight`` and ``height```
